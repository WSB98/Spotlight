# For Development
In order to authenticate yourself while working on the code you will need to login using firebase. Firebase only works when running locally if you are using localhost on 
port 80 / 'no port'. Firebase **DOES NOT WORK** when running locally from a port that is not 80 OR none (which is technically 80).
